    <h1>What are we looking for from a pair of headphones?</h1>
    <div class="main-text">
        <p>
            I love listening to music on speakers. There’s something visceral
            about feeling the sound fill the space I’m in. It also presents
            music in a more forgiving way. The detail is still presented, but by
            not feeling so close, I find problems are less attention pulling.
            When I was a child/teen, I would listen to music on my handed-down
            HiFi setup regularly. Even then, when it came to sheer listening
            hours, headphones reigned supreme. Portability and convenience are
            strong draws. As an adult, even stronger than these, the need to be
            bearable to live with has led to a further increase in percentage of
            time spent with headphones on.
        </p>
        <p>
            For many of us, headphones have been the primary listening method
            for most of our lives. They have kept us sane in noisy shared
            houses; brightened dark, miserable morning commutes; and, as much of
            a proponent for speakers as I am, provided the best quality
            listening experience that can be found when in small and changing
            locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think it is my combination of love of listening to music and
            interest in music production that have led me to spend, probably far
            too much, time thinking about how my listening setups should sound.
            The internet is not devoid of blame for this slight obsession. There
            are countless message board forums and YouTube comment sections
            where self-professed audiophiles will fight to the hilt over the
            differences made by tiny nuances of audio reproduction.
        </p>
        <p>
            What are we looking for from listening on a pair of headphones? Do
            we want perfect recreation of the audio file being played, or do we
            want the speaker listening experience replicated?
        </p>
        <p>
            One goal I have seen from several online aiming for is a feeling of
            realism from acoustic recordings, aiming to feel the artists are
            really there in front of you performing. Where you can close your
            eyes and imagine the musicians spread out on a stage, feeling as
            though you could open your eyes and find them to have been
            mystically transported to be there in the room. I find this kind of
            thinking aimless, and not just because the majority of the music I
            actually want to listen to does not fit in the box of super-clean
            recordings of acoustic performances. Consider this: which recording
            do we try and match our systems to? What if we get one song’s
            violins sounding perfectly like a violin does in real life, then
            another song’s acoustic guitar isn’t quite right? What about
            electronic music, will that sound ‘right’ on this setup? I’ll note
            here that I unfortunately have neither good enough sound memory, nor
            enough experience with violinists to trust I would recognise when it
            sounds realistic anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the production space, flat frequency responses are often focused
            on. This can at least be empirically measured. It does, however,
            only deal with one aspect of sound. You’ve still got to worry about
            distortion, imaging, soundstage, and the magical je ne c’est quoi
            that only a small mortgage and a good salesman can provide.
        </p>
        <p>
            My taste in headphone sound has largely been defined by my set of
            Shure SRH840s. The ‘s’ isn’t part of the product code, but it feels
            weird to refer to a set of headphones as singular. I’ve had these
            headphones for over a decade, and though the ‘leather’ on the
            headband and the first set of pads is slowly flaking away, I still
            use them weekly for recording the podcast. These act as my personal
            ‘flat frequency response’. Music on these headphones just sounds
            ‘normal’ to me. It turns out, according to graphs I’ve seen online,
            they are relatively flat for a set of closed back headphones.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the past year I’ve mostly switched to a set of Beyerdynamic DT
            900 Pro Xs (again, to ignore the ‘s’ is your prerogative). This was
            partly due to the aforementioned slow disintegration of my beloved
            Shure pair. But I was also interested to try a set of open back
            headphones. I had heard people online raving about wider soundstage
            and clearer high frequencies. Plus, as much as I love the 840s, they
            do have a few shortcomings. They less cup my head and more linger
            somewhere close to the edges of it with a lack of clamping force and
            thin, awkwardly shaped pads.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 900 Pro Xs needed a bit of taming. There’s a noticeable boost in
            the high end that makes voices and cymbals pop out more than I want
            and give them a (to me) unnatural sound. It’s not horrendous, but I
            might have returned them if I didn’t have the option of calibration.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve been using Sonarworks SoundID with them which provides
            frequency response correction, adjusting the computer’s output to
            offset problem areas in the headphone’s reproduction. It’s done the
            job. The Beyerdynamics sound close to my 840s frequency-wise once
            calibrated, but the soundstage is much wider, and the comfort makes
            wearing them for long periods much preferred.
        </p>
        <p>
            This set up has been consistent until last week. Beyerdynamic
            released a plugin called HEADPHONE LAB. Designed for producers, it
            provides two functions: frequency response correction, and speaker
            emulation. The former can replace SoundID for me. I haven’t done
            back-to-back comparisons, but I have no complaints listening to
            albums with Beyerdynamic’s plugin on, and don’t feel much
            requirement to go any deeper than that. One benefit is that for
            certain models, mine included, Beyerdynamic have used the
            measurements they take when the headphones are made in the factory
            to adjust for the profile of this specific set. The difference from
            the generic adjustment is subtle, but it is an improvement to my
            ears.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other side of the plugin is the one I’m still evaluating.
            Loudspeaker emulation is designed to make listening on headphones
            simulate listening to speakers in a studio environment. It is
            probably worth mentioning now that this feature doesn’t require a
            pair of Beyerdynamic headphones to use. SoundID has a feature like
            this, but it’s marketed as a way to check how your mixes will
            translate in different locations, whereas Beyerdynamic present it as
            a full alternative to listening to the standard output.
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept of a whole new way of listening to music on headphones
            raises a few interesting possibilities. The most obvious being, if
            it works, it could improve how enjoyable listening to music on
            headphones is. For producing music in small spaces, it could provide
            a better way of hearing what you’re creating. And, in a best-case
            scenario, it could for many instances, render speakers unnecessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, what does it actually do? Beyerdynamic don’t provide much
            detail. What I can hear is: there’s some short reverb being added to
            the signal and there’s some amount of crosstalk (an amount of one
            side’s signal being sent to the other). Both parameters are
            adjustable in the plugin. There’s a dry/wet dial for the room noise
            and three widths of speaker placement that seems to change the
            crosstalk. I’ve got the dry/wet set around 10 o’clock and the width
            set to 60 degrees (the middle setting).
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m incredibly sceptical of this kind of feature. I generally assume
            the fewer steps between the audio and the output device, the better.
            Plus, the audio industry has so many snake oil products, it’s
            fiscally prudent to assume everyone’s trying to rip you off. They
            usually boil down to washy reverb and EQ that makes it sound like
            its coming out of an FM radio’s built in speaker. You lose all the
            detail, and, moreover, it sounds awful. Beyerdynamic’s emulation
            feels different to me. It actually does a decent job of
            approximating the feeling of listening on speakers. You don’t get
            the feeling through your whole body, but the thump of a kick drum
            coming down the centre of the image gets much closer. It gives the
            impression of the centre image sounding more like it’s coming from
            in front of you than from the sides. Imaging, particularly on hard
            panned parts, feel more natural. I think this has made listening
            less fatiguing over long sessions. The sound does get a bit
            brighter, but not as an unpleasant peak like the default
            Beyerdynamic sound, it feels like a slight lift that still leaves
            the other frequencies clear underneath it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I need more time to settle in with this new setup, then to compare
            to without it, but I do have a concern that I am losing some detail
            with the loudspeaker emulation on. I don’t think small details are
            made as immediately apparent. To be fair, that would also be the
            case when listening on a set of speakers. That might also not be the
            worst thing. While tiny hidden details can be useful to have
            something to talk about on the podcast, generally they make no
            difference to the music, or present some small issue in how it was
            recorded or produced.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve tried, very briefly, using this feature for its actual purpose:
            production. My very early impression is I love it for composition. I
            often struggle in the early stages of writing finding that the
            sounds don’t sound cohesive, and I get pulled off track making minor
            adjustments to sounds before the key elements are together. This
            made drum machine samples sound closer to ‘right’ to my ear. I think
            for final touches, I’ll be switching back to traditional headphone
            output so I can hear more details when comparing with a reference
            track.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m going to stick with the loudspeaker emulation for a while.
            Finding it to sound good has helped me let go of the hunt for an
            ‘accurate’ representation of the music I’m listening to. On an
            intellectual level I’ve known for some time this feeling was
            unreasonable, but it’s taken something that seems technically
            imperfect that I’ve enjoyed listening to in order to shift the
            impulse.

            If you want to try it out, you can download HEADPHONE LAB for free
            from the Beyerdynamic website. It’s a VST, so loading it in a DAW
            for production is easy enough. For music listening, I have it
            opening in Foobar2000 using an extension. The lack of standalone
            mode does make it trickier when streaming from Qobuz. It’s
            definitely possible to do, just a bit more of a pain than SoundID
            which works well as a standalone app.

            You might have noticed a slight inconsistency of my use of the term
            headphones across this piece. To open, I was comparing headphones to
            speakers and at least heavily implying the inclusion of in-ears.
            Well, how does the speaker emulation hold up with Sony’s
            WF-1000XM5s. It’s not good. Drums and bass sound strangely boosted
            and compressed. The reduction in soundstage becomes problematic when
            you had less to begin with.
